# 🛠️ My Everyday CLI Tools

Welcome to my collection of handy CLI tools built to automate and simplify some of the repetitive tasks I run into regularly. If you find yourself dealing with similar routines, feel free to try them out — they might save you a few keystrokes too.

## 📦 Overview

This repo contains a growing set of small command-line utilities written in Python to assist with common tasks which I keep getting myself into. They're lightweight, hackable, and meant to make your terminal life easier.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The tools have the corresponding `exe` in the `dist` folder. It's mainly for windows(sorry about that, I ain't a full-time linux user yet. WSL gets the job done). You can clone the repo or download the built binary and set the path to use it anywhere from your terminal.

## Tools
### <u>frid</u>
A cli-tool to run you `avd` via its name(Only the ones setup via android studio)(Have to do for others) and then start the frida server on it (saved as `frida-server` on the emulator)

usage :- `frid <avd_name>`
